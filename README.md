# Practical Projects
## Here I will upload Mini Projects given to me by my SoftUni Mentor.
## Projects are an important part of my training as a software engineer, so the mentor assigns us additional tasks - in this repo I will upload code of those projects.
### The source code sometimes is small piece of code which I need to develop further.
